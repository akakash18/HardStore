# HardStore
This web application was created to manage all the product details and check the availability of each product in the store.
To create this project, I used Angular for the front end and Spring Boot and MySQL for the backend.

### This is the home page of the application.

### This is the product list page, where all the data that is present in the MySQL database is fetched and shown in table format. We can also update the data according to the stock present in our inventory, delete all data, and view specific products.
